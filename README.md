# Guess The Game
Lightweight winforms app for playing an image guessing games with your friends on share screens over voice chat.
Running the app creates a folder called "Images" (or you may create it yourself). Any folder inside the images folder will be counted as a game.
You may put any number of pictures inside any game folder, but the images will be read in alphabetical order - displaying the first one and upon clicking on it a few times, the subsequent ones as hints of some sort.
